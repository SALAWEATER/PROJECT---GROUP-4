# Mentalhealth-app
MentalHealth App is a Python-based application designed to provide users with a simple and interactive platform for managing mental wellness. It features a backend powered by a database (initialized with init_db.py), an API or server logic (app.py), and a user-friendly graphical interface (frontend.py). The app allows users to interact with mental health resources, possibly including mood tracking, journaling, or connecting with support tools. The application uses a modular structure and is easily set up using virtual environments, making it simple to run on both Windows and Unix-based systems.
